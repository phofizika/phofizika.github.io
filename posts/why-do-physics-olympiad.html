                        <p>Dear reader, I am Xinyang, and on behalf of the FIZIKA team, I would like to extend a warm welcome to you. I assume that if you are reading this blog, you are interested, at least a little bit, in physics. In this write-up, I would like to share a little about why you might want to pursue the Physics Olympiad and how you could approach it. Many of the ideas I share here actually come from my seniors, and I have found them very helpful in my own journey.</p>

                        <hr class="paragraph-separator"> {/* EXAMPLE HR TAG */}

                        <p>So, as you begin to read, I would like to ask you this question: why do you want to do Physics Olympiad? It might be for many reasons: "I am good at physics," "It is cool," "I am too bored," and so on. Initially, when I started, I didn’t have an answer either. I remember going to the first SJPO lesson conducted by my school and feeling completely lost as my seniors were teaching circuits that day. They presented us with the famous cube resistor problem and spent the entire lesson discussing it. I wasn’t quite able to follow, and after everyone left, I decided to stay back to clarify some doubts. The senior was kind enough to stay for a whole hour to work through the math with me (he used KVL). The working was very messy, but he solved it nonetheless. Just before we were done, he gave me another idea for the problem: using equipotential points. I listened, noted down the idea, and decided to go home and think about it.</p>

                        <hr class="paragraph-separator"> {/* EXAMPLE HR TAG */}

                        <p>Honestly, back then, I doubted I could figure it out, but I spent a few hours thinking and pondering his words. Since imagining how the current flows is hard, I decided to draw some diagrams. As I played around, something clicked, and in no time, I solved it. It was at that moment I became fond of the feeling of solving problems: the pure joy of thinking. As time progressed, I became better at it and started to use more difficult materials.</p>

                        <hr class="paragraph-separator"> {/* EXAMPLE HR TAG */}

                        <p>Advancing to July last year, just before my school’s first round of training ended, another senior asked me the same question I am asking you now: why do Physics Olympiad? I told him I found it fun. This is honestly a great answer, but he provided an alternative perspective. Imagine that you have obtained an SPhO Gold or IPhO Gold—what would you feel? Ecstatic, proud? Definitely, but would these feelings of happiness last very long? I doubt so. These emotions are fleeting. So if not for the honor, then what? This question actually boils down to a deeper philosophical one: why do we do anything in life? Well, obviously for happiness, right? But then what leads to happiness? For me, the answer is through helping others. It is one of the only sources of sustainable joy I can find. This is also the answer to that question: Doing Physics Olympiad allows you to help others. Maybe not directly now, but with a sharpened mind, you can do so in the future. This is precisely why I co-founded this program, with the goal of helping you with my knowledge.</p>

                        <hr class="paragraph-separator"> {/* EXAMPLE HR TAG */}

                        <p>So, now that you have an idea of why you might like to do Physics Olympiad, how should you go about doing it? Another senior once told me, "studying physics should be 99% your job and 1% the teacher’s job." I truly agree with this view. Fortunately, for beginners, I would say a more reasonable ratio would be 7:3. The trainers here will provide 30% of what is required, and the rest of that 100% needs to be done by you. Remember, teachers are always here to guide you, not lead you. The role of teachers is to introduce the topic to you and be there to help you navigate through the problems you face. However, always give your all before seeking help. "No pain, no gain," right?</p>

                        <hr class="paragraph-separator"> {/* EXAMPLE HR TAG */}

                        <p>So as you embark on this journey, remember that learning is a virtue in itself. And also, don’t forget to have fun!</p>
